# WEB APP TITLE: TBD

## React-Reux Application

## Planning:
- Use express, pg, sequelize for backend.
- Use react, redux, react-redux, redux-thunk, axios and whatever other libraries for front end.
- Allow user to modify backend database via post, delete, and put requests.
- Faker library to generate data (instead of using forms) for testing/development mode.
